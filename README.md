# [Impatient Princess](https://bendunc.itch.io/impatient-princess)

This was for the 2023 GMTK game jam hosted on itch.io. It was a ton of fun to do and I learned a lot! Aligning with the theme, the user plays as the princess who - this time - rescues herself! She must avoid enemies, traps, and solve puzzels to win. This was made in the Unity Game Engine.
