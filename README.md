# Ideas - Theme: ROLES REVERSED

### 1. Character Roles Reversed
- Player plays as villan, fights heroes.
- Play as boss of dungeon, fight heroes that come.
- Princess saves knights, beats BBEG.

### 2. Pun on words (roles -> rolls, i.e.: dice rolls, dinner rolls)
- Driving game but only drive in reverse.
- Rolling mechanic but you roll backwards.

### 3. (Meta) Reversing one role
- Reverse the steps of the ["Hero's Journey"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey).
